        <h2>About Me</h2><br>
        <p>I have switched my major two times during my time in college.<br><br>
        I started off as a creative writing major since I wrote *cough* fanfiction *cough* back in the day that people really liked.<br> 
        The idea of being an author seemed worthwhile at the time but I realized it wasn't going to pan out well for a career choice.<br>
        I then switched into IT (Information Technology) because I had an interest in computers and I thought I could make a living off<br>
        of helping people fix both theirs and mine.<br>
        Needless to say, I was downright miserable for the next two years because of that decision.<br>
        However, at the same time, I discovered that I liked coding.<br>
        It's just that I was robbing myself of my creativity, the quality I pride myself on.<br><br>
        When I transferred to the University of Central Florida, it was during the first semester that<br>I came to the decision that I couldn't do IT anymore.<br>
        I took a risk and, thankfully, because of how similar Digital Media was to IT, I was able to switch into the program.<br>
        I would be starting the very next semester...after a tragedy occured in my family.<br>
        I won't go into the specifics, but I lost someone that I wish I still had in my life today.<br>
        So, with that said, my personal life may be a bit pessimistic right now.<br>
        Its not all bad but its been really hard for me to look on the bright side of things.<br>
        However, I'm glad that I'm a Digital Media major.<br>
        I wouldn't have it any other way.
