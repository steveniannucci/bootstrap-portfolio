                    <p>
                        This is an exercise tracker app I made using the React Native framework and Expo CLI. Clicking on an exercise on the main menu will bring the user to one of two screens.
                        One screen is for duration type exercises where the user can start, stop and reset a timer. The other screen is for repetition type exercises where the user can incremement and reset the number of reps they did. It's tracked via a counter.
                        Each exercise will have a suggested exercise. Clicking the button above the counter will take the user directly to that exercise. Getting the suggested exercise button was definitely a challenge for me.
                        I had to find some way to pass the suggested exercise listed in the exercises array and have it take the user to that exercise. Along with the title of the exercise, I had to also pass in the suggested exercise to the navigation prop for it to transfer over.
                        I then needed to add the suggested exercise to the route params and pass that into a variable with the useCallback hook. Then I had to add the suggested exercise to the navigation prop in the onPress event handler for the suggested exercise button.
                        The colors in the design I went with for the app is orange and white. I felt that they would be a good fit for the exercise app. I also made the font bold for all of the text in the app not including the counter or timer so that it would be easier for the user to read.
