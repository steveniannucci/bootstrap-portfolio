            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This is the design I came up with for the exercise app before I started developing it. The main menu (first slide) is the only screen that I didn't deviate from when making the final product.
                I originally assumed that there would be a duration, repitition, and resistance screen for each exercise. However, I was supposed to only have either a duration or repitition screen for each.
                I also planned for the user to be able to navigate between screens by tapping on the indicators at the bottom of the screen or swiping left or right. 
                This wasn't necessary for the final product so I scrapped the idea. The duration screen (second slide) was originally going to have two different options for resetting the timer. 
                One option was to reset the timer to a certain time that was previously set by the user. The other option is to set the timer at 00:00:00. Only the latter option was needed.
                I planned for the repitition screen (third slide) to have an option to increment the counter by 1 and decrement it in case the user miscounted. 
                It would save them the inconvinience of having to reset the counter during a set. The latter option was also scrapped but it would've been easy to implement otherwise.
                I came up with the resistance screen (fourth slide) to expand on the repitition screen. On this screen, there would be two seperate counters for weight and reps.
                The user would have the option to increment and decrement the rep count just like they would be able to on the repitition screen. 
                However, they would also be able to increment or decrement the weight counter by 5 depending on how much weight they're adding or taking off.
                The user would also be able to reset the weight counter to 0. I didn't consider adding the option of clearing the rep counter when designing the screen. Regardless, the resistance screen wasn't needed in the final product.
