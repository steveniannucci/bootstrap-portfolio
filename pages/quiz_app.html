                    <p>
                        This is a simple quiz app I made using the React Native framework and Expo CLI that accepts a list of questions and answers and renders them to the screen. The user can click on one or more answers depending on the type of question for each question. 
                        Their score is calculated and the quiz results are displayed on a summary screen after all of the questions have been answered. If the user got the correct answer for a question, the answer is highlighted in green. Otherwise, their choice is highlighted in grey.
                        Regardless, the choices they make are bolded to indicate that they're theirs. The correct answers to each question are checked. To clarify why an answer is correct, I added a brief explanation for each question. I thought adding that would make the quiz more engaging for the user.
                        One problem I had to solve was how to get the correct answers to display on the summary screen. To do that, I had to pass the correct answers to the summary screen as a prop and then map through the answers array to check if the user's answer matched the correct answer or not.
                        I was aiming for functionality over aestethics with the design of the app. It's black text on a white background with blue buttons on the questions screen. The summary screen has the same design without the buttons. This way, the design is consistent throughout the app.
